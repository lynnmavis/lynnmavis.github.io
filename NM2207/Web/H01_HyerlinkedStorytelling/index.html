     		I glanced at the paper. Classroom 4A. I walked briskly, fussing with the black bag. They said the black bag contained calming tools – to calm the students when they trigger. I walked into the classroom scattered with room dividers. Each student had their own space. I glanced around hesitantly. They said I am mostly in charge of the female student. There she was, rocking back and forth in her seat.

      		I began to walk towards her. She looked at me up and down and scowled. “Careful, this one attacks… and bites,” a man warned from behind. This job seems tough already. The man passed me her daily schedule. I skimmed it through in surprise. “I have to bring her to the toilet…?” “Of course, this is why we are typically assigned by gender.” He looked over, “you’re up – the first toilet break is now.” I took out a mini whiteboard and wrote down some simple instructions. While we were leaving for the toilet down the corridor, the man asked if I had the crisis hotline saved in my phone. I nodded and saw her flinched from the corner of my eye.

      		I stood awkwardly in the toilet. This attachment was going to be a tough four months. Suddenly, the door creaked open. Another student sauntered into the toilet and entered the only other cubicle. She did not seem to notice my presence. I looked at my watch. Does she usually take this long? That was when I heard a piercing scream. I felt myself tensed up. I only had a few seconds to react before she came out of her cubicle. What if she attacks me? What if she attacks the other student who seem oblivious?
