Hello there! I am **Mavis Ang**. I graduated from National University of Singapore (NUS) with a Bachelor of Science in Project and Facilities Management. I am currently exploring the built industry. Aside, I find joy in learning and creating new things. All the designs featured here are created with Photoshop, Illustrator, Canva, XD, Balsamiq and Figma.
