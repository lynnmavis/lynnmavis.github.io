NM3221 is a module on mobile interaction design. In this module, we had to participate in a group and individual project. In the group project, we focused on improving the UIUX of the Shopee app. For the individual project, I had to conduct background research, user research, customer journey mapping, user testing and design iterations. I decided to take on a virtual try-on based shopping application. Below are some snippets of my group and individual project:

<!--- ## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
